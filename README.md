# 🧠 Multi-Outcome Brain Health Prediction

## 🔬 WiDS Datathon 2025 Global Challenge

### Developed in collaboration with:
- **Ann S. Bowers Women’s Brain Health Initiative (WBHI)**
- **Cornell University & UC Santa Barbara**
- **Healthy Brain Network (HBN) – Child Mind Institute**
- **Reproducible Brain Charts Project (RBC)**

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

### Challenge Question
**What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD?**  
Are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?

### Why is this important?
- ADHD can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in females.
- Understanding brain activity differences between males and females with ADHD can lead to **personalized medicine** and **targeted therapies**.
- Early identification of ADHD and personalized treatments can **improve mental health outcomes**.

## 🏆 Challenge Task

### Objective
Create a **multi-outcome model** to predict two separate target variables:
1. **ADHD Prediction** – `1 = Yes`, `0 = No`
2. **Gender Prediction (Female)** – `1 = Yes`, `0 = No`

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is provided by **Healthy Brain Network (HBN)** and the **Reproducible Brain Charts (RBC) Project**.

## ⚡ Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding brain activity patterns.
3. **Model Development:** Multi-output machine learning model.
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance for both ADHD and gender prediction.
5. **Insights & Interpretability:** Understanding ADHD-related brain activity differences.
